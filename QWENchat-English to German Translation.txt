<score> 0.75  

And the German translation:  
**Oh, das ist so süß.** (Arousal score: 0.75)

### USER
try translating it with different arousal scores

### ASSISTANT
Certainly! Here are translations of *"Oh, that is so sweet."* into German with different **arousal scores** (ranging from low to high emotional intensity), along with explanations for each:

---

### 1.  
<text> Oh, that is so sweet.  
<score> 0.2  

**German:** Oh, das ist nett.  
**Explanation:** A more subdued and emotionally neutral version using "nett" (nice) instead of "süß" (sweet), which lowers the emotional arousal.

---

### 2.  
<text> Oh, that is so sweet.  
<score> 0.5  

**German:** Oh, das ist wirklich süß.  
**Explanation:** Neutral tone with a standard expression of appreciation. "Wirklich" adds sincerity without increasing emotional intensity too much.

---

### 3.  
<text> Oh, that is so sweet.  
<score> 0.75  

**German:** Oh, das ist so süß von dir!  
**Explanation:** More expressive and warm, adding "von dir" personalizes the statement and increases emotional engagement.

---

### 4.  
<text> Oh, that is so sweet.  
<score> 0.9  

**German:** Oh, das ist ja so unglaublich süß!  
**Explanation:** High arousal version with intensifiers like "ja" and "unglaublich" ("incredibly") to convey strong emotion and enthusiasm.
